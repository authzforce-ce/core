## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you want to report a vulnerability, you must do so on the [OW2 Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.ow2.org/authzforce/core/issues) and **make sure the checkbox** *This issue is confidential and should only be visible to team members with at least Reporter access* **is checked when creating the issue**. Then, if the AuthzForce team can confirm it, they will uncheck it to make the issue public.
