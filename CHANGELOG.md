## 20.3.0
### Fixed
- Upgraded parent project (8.4.1) to fix CVEs in following dependencies:
  - `org.json:json` upgraded to 20230227
  - `org.springframework:spring-core` upgraded to 5.3.27
- GH-73: Exception thrown when a Rule's Condition always returns False.

### Added
- Policy / Rule evaluation optimization: if the Rule's Condition is always False, then the Rule is always NotApplicable as per section 7.11 of XACML 3.0, therefore skip the Rule.


## 20.2.0
### Added
- [GH-69] Support for XACML `<StatusDetail>` / `<MissingAttributeDetail>`s, returned when missing named Attribute(s) in AttributeDesignator/AttributeSelector expressions, and may be returned by custom PDP extensions as well. See the example of [custom RequestPreprocessor](pdp-testutils/src/test/java/org/ow2/authzforce/core/pdp/testutil/test/CustomTestRequestPreprocessorFactory.java) (PDP extension) adding AttributeId/Category to [custom AttributeValues](pdp-testutils/src/test/java/org/ow2/authzforce/core/pdp/testutil/test/TestExtensibleSimpleValue.java) (PDP extension) and the [custom function](pdp-testutils/src/test/java/org/ow2/authzforce/core/pdp/testutil/test/TestExtensibleSimpleValueEqualFunction.java) (PDP extension) using this info to throw a standard `missing-attribute` error with `<MissingAttributeDetail>` inside a `<StatusDetail>` element; and also the [example of XACML response](pdp-testutils/src/test/resources/custom/CustomRequestPreproc/response.xml) and [PDP configuration](pdp-testutils/src/test/resources/custom/CustomRequestPreproc/pdp.xml).
- Upgraded dependency authzforce-ce-core-pdp-api: 21.3.0:
  - `ImmutableXacmlStatus` and `IndeterminateEvaluationException` classes improved: new constructors supporting XACML `MissingAttributeDetail` element
  - `BaseXacmlJaxbRequestPreprocessor` and `SingleDecisionXacmlJaxbRequestPreprocessor` classes improved: new constructor arg: `customNamedAttributeParser` to allow XACML/XML RequestPreprocessor extensions to customize the parsing of named Attributes with minimal effort.

## 20.1.0
### Fixed
- Fix CVE-2020-36518 affecting jackson dependency

### Changed
- Upgrade authzforce-ce-core-pdp-api to 21.2.0
  
  - New `XMLUtils.SAXBasedXmlnsFilteringParser` class constructor parameter - XML namespace prefix-to-URI mappings - to help fix the issue authzforce/server#66 .

### Added
- New `PdpEngineConfiguration` class constructor parameter - XML namespace prefix-to-URI mappings - to help fix the issue authzforce/server#66 .


## 20.0.0
### Added
- New feature: XPath variables in AttributeSelectors' and `xPathExpression` `AttributeValues`s' XPath expressions can now be defined by XACML VariableDefinitions (variable name used as XACML VariableId), which means XACML Variables can be used as XPath variables there.

### Changed
- Upgraded dependency `authzforce-ce-core-pdp-api` to 21.1.1

  - Changed Datatype extension interface (`AttributeValueFactory`) in support of the new feature above:

      - `getInstance(...)` `XPathCompiler` parameter replaced with `Optional<XPathCompilerProxy>`, where XPathCompilerProxy is a immutable version of `XPathCompiler` class with extra methods; the parameter is optional because XPath support may be disabled by PDP configuration or missing Policy(Set)Defaults/XPathVersion in XACML Policy(Set)
      - `Datatype` interface: added `ItemType getXPathItemType()` method used to declare Variable types on Saxon XPath evaluator when compiling XPath expressions with variables
      - `AttributeValue` must now implement `getXdmItem()` to return a XPath-compatible (XDM) value to be used as variables in XPath expressions, in order to support the new Feature mentioned above.


## 19.0.0
### Changed
- Parent project `authzforce-ce-parent` upgraded to 8.2.0: upgraded following dependencies:
  - SLF4j to 1.7.32
  - Spring core to 5.3.14

- PDP configuration XSD (`pdp.xsd`): `pdp/@version` attribute changed from required to optional with default value equal to xsd version
- PDP-schema-derived (JAXB-annotated) classes changed: using XJC plugin `immutable-xjc-plugin` instead of `jaxb2-value-constructor`
- Removed `BasePdpdEngine` class constructor arg: `xacmlExpressionFactory`
- Removed `RootPolicyEvaluators.Base` class constructor arg: `xacmlExpressionFactory`
- Removed `PdpEngineConfiguration#getXacmlExpressionFactory()` method.


## 18.0.0
### Changed  
- **Changed the PDP configuration XML schema (XSD): refer to [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) for migrating your PDP configurations (e.g. `pdp.xml`) to the new schema**:
    - XML namespace changed to `http://authzforce.github.io/core/xmlns/pdp/8`
    - `useStandardDatatypes` replaced with `standardDatatypesEnabled`;
    - `useStandardFunctions` replaced with `standardFunctionsEnabled` 
    - `useStandardCombiningAlgorithms` replaced with `standardCombiningAlgorithmsEnabled`
    - `enableXPath` replaced with `xPathEnabled`
    - `standardEnvAttributeSource` replaced with `standardAttributeProvidersEnabled` and new `attributeProvider` type `StdEnvAttributeProviderDescriptor`
  
- `authzforce-ce-core-pdp-api` upgraded to 19.0.0: **APIs changed**:

    - For better support of Multiple Decision profile, request evaluation methods of the following interfaces  - including PDP extensions - now take an extra optional parameter (`Optional<EvaluationContext>`) for the Multiple Decision Request context: `PdpEngine`, `CombiningAlg`, `Function`, `NamedAttributeProvider`, `PolicyProvider`.
    - For better support of standard `current-dateTime/date/time` attributes and better request logging, `DecisionRequest` and `EvaluationContext` interfaces have a new method `getCreationTimestamp()` that must provide the date/time of the request/context creation.
    - `EvaluationContext`: replaced `putNamedAttributeValueIfAbsent(AttributeFqn, AttributeBag)` with more generic `putNamedAttributeValue(AttributeFqn, AttributeBag, boolean override)`
  
- [GH-61]: fixed a limitation of XACML 3.0 standard `Match` not allowing VariableReferences: AuthzForce Core now supports XACML `VariableReference` equivalents in `Match` elements through special `AttributeDesignators`, i.e. by enabling the new built-in Attribute Provider (`XacmlVariableBasedAttributeProvider` class) with an `attributeProvider` element of the new type `XacmlVarBasedAttributeProviderDescriptor` in PDP configuration, any `AttributeDesignator`s with `Category` matching the `attributeProvider/@category` in PDP configuration is handled as a `VariableReference` and the `AttributeId` is handled as the `VariableId`.
- [GH-62]: Refactored the provisioning of standard environment attributes `current-dateTime`, `current-date` and `current-time`:
  - Now implemented by a new built-in AttributeProvider (`StandardEnvironmentAttributeProvider` class) which can be customized (to override or not the request values) in the PDP configuration with an `attributeProvider` of type `StdEnvAttributeProviderDescriptor`.
- `authzforce-ce-core-pdp-testutils` module: upgraded jongo dependency to 1.5.0, mongo-java-driver to 3.12.10
- `authzforce-ce-core-pdp-cli` module: upgraded picocli to 4.6.2, testng to 6.14.3
- `authzforce-ce-parent` upgraded to 8.1.0
    
### Added
- Attribute Provider (`NamedAttributeProvider`) interface: added 2 new methods for better support of the Multiple Decision Profile (all implemented by default to do nothing):
  - `beginMultipleDecisionRequest(EvaluationContext mdpContext)`: for special processing in the context of the MDP request (before corresponding Individual Decision requests are evaluated)
  - `supportsBeginMultipleDecisionRequest()`: indicates whether the Attribute Provider implements `beginMultipleDecisionRequest()` method and therefore needs the PDP engine to call it when a new MDP request is evaluated
  - `beginIndividualDecisionRequest(EvaluationContext individualDecisionContext, Optional<EvaluationContext> mdpContext)`: for special processing in the context of an Individual Decision request, before it is evaluated against policies (before the `get(attribute)` method is ever called for the individual decision request).
  - `supportsBeginIndividualDecisionRequest()`: indicates whether the Attribute Provider implements `beginIndividualDecisionRequest()` method and therefore needs the PDP engine to call it when a new individual decision request is evaluated.

### Fixed
- Upgraded dependency `authzforce-ce-xacml-json-model` to 3.0.1 to fix issue with method `XacmlJsonUtils#canonicalizeResponse()` when comparing similar XACML/JSON responses (linked to https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java/issues/589)
- Upgraded dependency `authzforce-ce-core-pdp-api` to 18.0.1 to fix issue authzforce/server#62 : same XML namespace prefix cannot be reused in more than one namespace declaration when parsing XACML documents with `XmlUtils$SAXBasedXmlnsFilteringParser`

- Support for combining multiple Policy Providers corresponding to multiple `policyProvider` elements in PDP configuration (change to XML schema) 
- Support for inline PolicySets in a `StaticPolicyProvider` configuration, may be combined with already existing `policyLocation` elements
- Core StaticPolicyProvider enhanced to support the two previously mentioned changes, with the limitation that it can be combined with other previously declared policy providers only if they are static (implement `StaticPolicyProvider` interface).

## 13.3.1
### Fixed
- CVE affecting Spring v4.3.18: upgraded dependencies to depend on
4.3.20:
	- upgraded authzforce-ce-parent: 7.5.1
	- authzforce-ce-xacml-json-model: 2.1.1
- CVE-2018-1000873 on Jackson (Jongo dependency): upgraded:
	- jackson-databind: 2.9.8


## 13.3.0
### Changed
- Maven parent project version: 7.5.0
- Maven dependencies:
  - authzforce-ce-core-pdp-api: 15.3.0
  	  - Guava: 24.1.1-jre
  	  - jaxb2-basics: 1.11.1

  - Spring: 4.3.18 (fixes CVE)
  - authzforce-ce-xacml-json-model: 2.1.0
- XML schema for AuthzForce test extensions (namespace `http://authzforce.github.io/core/xmlns/test/3`, located in file `org.ow2.authzforce.core.pdp.testutil.ext.xsd`) has been modified, esp. names of XML types, in order to avoid confusion between schema-derived (JAXB-annotated) classes describing the configuration of an AuthzForce extension, and its corresponding Java (logic) implementation:
	- XML type `TestAttributeProvider` renamed to `TestAttributeProviderDescriptor`;
	- XML type `MongoDBBasedPolicyProvider`renamed to `MongoDBBasedPolicyProviderDescriptor`.	
- Copyright company name

### Added
- Dependency: javax.mail 1.6.0 (mail-api implementation for XACML RFC822Name support)
- Feature: 
	- EnvironmentProperties#replacePlaceholders() method now supports system properties and environment variables; and a default value (separated from the property name by '!') if the property is undefined. Therefore, PDP extensions such as Attribute and Policy Providers can accept placeholders for system properties and environment variables in their string configuration parameters (as part of PDP configuration) and perform placeholder replacements with their factory method's input EnvironmentProperties.
	- In particular, 'policyLocation' elements in PDP's Policy Providers configuration now supports (not only PARENT_DIR property but also) system
properties and environment variables (enclosed between '${...}') with default value if property/variable undefined.


## 13.2.0
### Changed
- Maven dependency versions:
  - `authzforce-ce-core-pdp-api`: 15.2.0 (change in `ExpressionFactory` interface: new method `getVariableExpression(variableId)`)
- Policy / `VariableDefinition` evaluation: a XACML Variable expressions is now evaluated and the Variable assigned in the EvaluationContext where the `VariableDefinition` is defined (as opposed to previous behavior which consisted in lazy evaluation, ie only when used in a corresponding `VariableReference`), making the Variable's value available not only to `VariableReference` but also PDP extensions such as Attribute Providers, even if no corresponding `VariableReference` occurs in the policy
- `Time-in-range` function optimized (removed useless code)
- `GenericAttributeProviderBasedAttributeDesignatorExpression` class moved to dependency authzforce-ce-core-pdp-api

- PDP configuration schema (`pdp.xsd`) / StaticRefPolicyProvider XML type: 
  - Added support for recursive directory searching of policies, e.g. pattern '.../*/*.xml' for searching on two directory levels
  - Added option to ignore old versions (keep only the latest) when multiple versions of same policy ID found: `ignoreOldVersions=true`


## 13.0.0 
### Changed
- authzforce-ce-core-pdp-api version: 15.0.0. [More info](https://github.com/authzforce/core-pdp-api/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#1500).

### Fixed
- pdp-testutils module depends on jongo version which depends on jackson-databind version < 2.9.5 affected by CVE-2018-7489. Fix: upgrade to 2.9.5.

- `BasePdpEngine#evaluate(IndividualDecisionRequest)` not using enabled decision cache


## 12.0.0
### Changed
- Dependency authzforce-ce-core-pdp-api: version 13.0.0 -> 14.0.0; changes APIs for PDP AttributeProvider and DecisionCache extensions:
	- Interface method DecisionCache.Factory#getInstance(...): added EnvironmentProperties parameter to allow passing environment properties to DecisionCache implementations
	- Interface method AttributeProvider#get(...): replaced parameter type BagDatatype with Datatype to simplify AttributeProviders' code

### Added
- Base implementations of a few interfaces to help implement unit tests for PDP extensions:
	- BasePrimaryPolicyMetadata, implements PrimaryPolicyMetadata
	- IndividualDecisionRequestContext, implements EvaluationContext


## 11.0.1
### Fixed
- [GL-6]: IllegalArgumentException when applying XACML 'map' function to substring with string bag as first arg
- Dependency of pdp-testutils module - Jongo 1.3.0 - depends on jackson-databind 2.7.3 which is affected by CVE-2018-5968. Fixed by forcing version of jackson-databind to 2.9.4 in file 'pom.xml', until Jongo team fixes the issue (https://github.com/bguerout/jongo/issues/327)


## 11.0.0
### Changed
- Upgraded dependency authzforce-ce-core-pdp-api: 12.1.0 -> 13.0.0

### Added
- [GH-10]: new API feature allowing to create `AttributeValue`s or `AttributeBag`s from raw standard Java types using [default Java-to-XACML-type mappings](../../wiki/Default-Java-XACML-type-mappings) (without specifying the XACML datatype explicitly). This is done by calling `AttributeValueFactoryRegistry#newAttributeValue(Serializable)` (for creating AttributeValue) or `AttributeValueFactoryRegistry#newAttributeBag(Collection)` (for creating AttributeBag) methods, using `StandardAttributeValueFactories.getRegistry(...)` to get the proper `AttributeValueFactoryRegistry` instance to do that.  


## 10.3.0
### Fixed
- [GH-9]: authzforce-ce-core-pdp-cli NullPointerException with filenames specified as relative paths to PDP configuration file and XACML request in arguments

		- org.everit.json.schema: 1.6.0 -> 1.6.1
		- guava: 21.0 -> 22.0
		- json: 20170516 -> 20171018
	- authzforce-ce-core-pdp-api: 12.0.0 -> 12.1.0

- Dependency version: core-pdp-api: 11.0.0 ->12.0.0
- Changed PDP configuration XSD: 5.0.0 -> 6.0.0:
	- Replaced attribute `badRequestStatusDetailLevel` with `clientRequestErrorVerbosityLevel`
	- Replaced attributes `requestFilter` and `resultFilter` with element `ioProcChain` of new type `InOutProcChain` defining a pair of request preprocessor (ex-requestFilter) and result postprocessor (ex-resultFilter)
	- Added `maxIntegerValue` attribute allowing to define the expected max integer value to be handled by the PDP engine during evaluation, based on which the engine selects the best Java representation among several (BigInteger, Long, Integer) for memory and CPU usage optimization

	* `RootPolicyProviderModule` -> `RootPolicyProvider`
	* `(Base)DatatypeFactory(Registry)` -> `(Base)AttributeValueFactory(Registry)` (using new `AttributeDatatype` subclass of `Datatype`)
- Core PDP engine made agnostic of decision request/response formats, and extensible through `PdpEngineInoutAdapter` interface, and more specifically `DecisionRequestPreprocessor` and `DecisionResultPostprocessor` interfaces, in order to support new types of input/output (SerDes) formats (native implementations provided for XACML 3.0/XML - core specification - using JAXB API, and XACML/JSON - JSON Profile of XACML 3.0)
- Identifiers of native PDP requestFilter/resultFilter (now requestPreproc/resultPostproc) extensions: 
	- *...:request-filter:...* renamed to *...:request-preproc:xacml-xml:...*
	- *...result-filter:...* renamed to *...:result-postproc:xacml-xml:...*	
- Replaced `JaxbXacmlUtils` utility class with `Xacml3JaxbHelper` (in authzforce-ce-xacml-model dependency)
- Changed naming convention for Java class names with acronym(s) (only first letter should be uppercase), e.g. PolicyPOJO -> PolicyPojo

### Added	
- Module `pdp-io-xacml-json` - XACML JSON Profile implementation: provides PDP extensions for processing (request/result pre/postprocessors) JSON input/output formats defined by JSON Profile of

  - Aded BaseStaticRefPolicyProviderModule class as convenient base class for implementing static Policy Provider (StaticRefPolicyProviderModule) implementations

### Added
- [PolicyProvider implementation](pdp-testutils/src/main/java/org/ow2/authzforce/core/pdp/testutil/ext/MongoDbPolicyProvider.java) for testing and documentation purposes, using MongoDB as policy database system and Jongo as client library, with [JUnit test class](pdp-testutils/src/test/java/org/ow2/authzforce/core/pdp/testutil/test/MongoDbPolicyProviderTest.java) showing how to use it.


## 8.0.0
### Changed
- Version of parent project: 5.1.0
- Version of dependency authzforce-ce-core-pdp-api: 9.1.0 (API changes)
- License: GPL v3.0 replaced with Apache License v2.0
- Project URL: 'https://tuleap.ow2.org/projects/authzforce' replaced with 'https://authzforce.ow2.org'
- GIT repository URL base: 'https://tuleap.ow2.org/plugins/git/authzforce' replaced with 'https://gitlab.ow2.org/authzforce'
- Project converted to multimodule project with two new modules in order to have properly separated artifact with the test utility classes to be reused in other AuthzForce projects (e.g. `server/webapp` and PDP extensions), therefore two new Maven artifacts:
	- `authzforce-ce-core-pdp-engine` replacing artifact `authzforce-ce-core` (no classifier);
	- `authzforce-ce-core-pdp-testutils` replacing artifact `authzforce-ce-core` with `tests` classifier.


## 7.1.0
### Added
- [JIRA-26] Simplify evaluation of Apply expression with commutative numeric function f (e.g. add and multiply): if multiple arguments are constants A, B..., then: `f(a1,...an, A, b1,...bn, B, c1,...) = f(C, a1,...an, b1,...bn, c1...)` where `C = f(A,B...)` and a1,...an, b1,...bn, c1,... are the other arguments (variables).

### Fixed
- [JIRA-25] - Reopened - NullPointerException when parsing Apply expressions using invalid/unsupported Function ID. This is the final fix addressing higher-order functions. (Initial fix only addressed first-order ones.)
- Artifact `authzforce-ce-core` with `tests` classifier: missing classes.


## 7.0.0
### Changed
- Changed parent version: 4.1.1 -> 5.0.0
- Changed dependency versions:
	- AuthzForce Core PDP API: 8.2.0 -> 9.0.0
	- SLF4J: 1.7.6 -> 1.7.22
	- Spring: 4.3.5 -> 4.3.6
	- Guava: 20.0 -> 21.0
- Renamed `PDPImpl` class to `BasePdpEngine` implements new `PDPEngine` API

### Removed
- Removed/Merged `PdpConfigurationParser` class into new `BasePdpEngine` class (replacing `PDPImpl`)

### Added
- Unit test of CXF authorization interceptor (web service PEP) using AuthForce PDP engine, based on
 @coheiga's [XACML 3.0 Authorization Interceptor test](https://github.com/coheigea/testcases/blob/master/apache/cxf/cxf-sts-xacml/src/test/java/org/apache/coheigea/cxf/sts/xacml/authorization/xacml3/XACML3AuthorizationTest.java)


## 6.1.0
### Changed
- Parent project version: 4.0.0 -> 4.1.1 => Changed dependency versions: 
    - Spring 4.3.4 -> 4.3.5, 
    - Saxon-HE 9.7.0-11 -> 9.7.0-14
- authzforce-ce-core-pdp-api dependency version: 8.0.0 -> 8.2.0

### Fixed
- Security issues reported by Find Security Bugs plugin


## 6.0.0
### Added
- Extension mechanism to switch HashMap/HashSet implementation; default implementation is based on native JRE and Guava.
- Validation of 'n' argument (minimum of *true* arguments) of XACML 'n-of' function if this is constant (must be a positive integer not greater than the number of remaining arguments)
- Validation of second and third arguments of XACML substring function if these are constants (arg1 >= 0 && (arg2 == -1 || arg2 >= arg1))
- Maven plugin owasp-dependency-check to check vulnerabilities in dependencies

### Changed
- Maven parent project version: 3.4.0 -> 4.0.0:
	- [GH-4] **Java version: 1.7 -> 1.8**
	- Guava dependency version: 18.0 -> 20.0
	- Saxon-HE dependency version: 9.6.0-5 -> 9.7.0-11
	- com.sun.mail:javax.mail v1.5.4 changed to com.sun.mail:mailapi v1.5.6
- Dependency authzforce-ce-core-pdp-api 7.1.1 -> 8.0.0
- Behavior of *unordered* rule combining algorithms (deny-overrides, permit-overrides, deny-unless-permit and permit-unless deny), i.e. for which the order of evaluation may be different from the order of declaration: child elements are re-ordered for more efficiency (e.g. Deny rules evaluated first in case of deny-overrides algorithm), therefore the algorithm implementation, the order of evaluation in particular, now differs from ordered-* variants.

### Removed
- Dependency on Koloboke, replaced by extension mechanism mentioned in *Added* section that would allow switching from the default HashMap/HashSet implementation to Koloboke-based.

### Fixed
- [JIRA-23] Enforcement of RuleId/PolicyId/PolicySetId uniqueness:
	- PolicyId (resp. PolicySetId) should be unique across all policies loaded by PDP so that PolicyIdReferences (resp. PolicySetIdReferences) in Responses' PolicyIdentifierList are absolute references to applicable policies (no ambiguity).
 	- [RuleId should be unique within a policy](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/xacml/201310/msg00025.html) -> A rule is globally uniquely identified by the parent PolicyId and the RuleId.
- [JIRA-25] NullPointerException when parsing Apply expressions using invalid/unsupported Function ID. Partial fix addressing only invalid first-order functions. See release 7.0.1 for final fix addressing higher-order functions too.


## 5.0.2
### Changed
- Dependency version: authzforce-core-pdp-api: 7.1.1 (was: 7.1.0)


## 5.0.1
### Fixed
- [JIRA-22] When handling the same XACML Request twice in the same JVM with the root PolicySet using deny-unless-permit algorithm over a Policy returning simple Deny (no status/obligation/advice) and a Policy returning Permit/Deny with obligations/advice, the obligation is duplicated in the final result at the second time this situation occurs. 
- XACML StatusCode XML serialization/marshalling error when Missing Attribute info that is no valid anyURI is returned by PDP in an Indeterminate Result
- Memory management issue: native RootPolicyProvider modules keeping a reference to static refPolicyProvider, even after policies have been resolved statically at initialization time, preventing garbage collection and memory saving.
- Calls to Logger impacted negatively by autoboxing

### Removed
- 'functionSet' element no longer supported in PDP XML configuration schema

### Changed
- PDP XML configuration schema namespace: http://authzforce.github.io/core/xmlns/pdp/5.0 (previous namespace: http://authzforce.github.io/core/xmlns/pdp/3.6). See *Removed* section for non-backward-compatible changes to the schema.
- Parent project version: authzforce-ce-parent: 3.4.0
- Dependency version: authzforce-ce-core-pdp-api: 7.1.0: requires passing a new EnvironmentProperties parameter to AttributeProvider module factories for using global PDP environment properties (such as PDP configuration file's parent directory)
- Interpretation of XACML Request flag ReturnPolicyId=true, considering a policy "applicable" if and only if the decision is not NotApplicable and if it is not a root policy, the same goes for the enclosing policy. See also the discussion on the xacml-comment mailing list: https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/xacml-comment/201605/msg00004.html

### Added
- New PDP configuration parameter: 'standardEnvAttributeSource' (enum) sets the source for the Standard Current Date/Time Environment Attribute values (current-date, current-time, current-dateTime), possible values: PDP_ONLY, REQUEST_ELSE_PDP, REQUEST_ONLY
- New PDP configuration parameter: 'badRequestStatusDetailLevel': Level of detail in the StatusDetail returned in Indeterminate Results when the XACML Request syntax/content is invalid. Increasing this value usually helps better pinpoint the issue with the Request.
- enum StandardFunction that enumerates all standard XACML function IDs
- enum StandardEnvironmentAttribute that enumerates all XACML standard environment attribute identifiers
- enum StandardCombiningAlgoritm that enumerates all standard XACML combining algorithms

### Deprecated
- Ability to marshall internal classes derived from XACML/JAXB Expressions back to the original JAXB Expression: it may consume a significant amount of extra memory, esp. when a nested PolicySet has deep nested Policy(Set)s, and it forces our internal evaluation classes to duplicate information and override many methods. Also, it ties the internal model to the JAXB model which is far from optimal for evaluation purposes. Now we consider no longer the responsibility of the PDP to be able to marshall such XACML instances, but the caller's; in particular the classes ApplyExpression, AttributeDesignatorExpression, AttributeSelectorExpression, AttributeAssigmnentExpressionEvaluator no longer extend JAXB classes.


## 4.0.2
### Fixed
- Issues reported by Codacy (including fixed issues in upgraded dependency core-pdp-api 4.0.2)


## 4.0.0
### Changed
- Native PDP request filter IDs (values of `pdp` configuration element's `requestFilter` attribute):
	- `urn:ow2:authzforce:xacml:request-filter:default-lax` changed to `urn:ow2:authzforce:feature:pdp:request-filter:default-lax`;
	- `urn:ow2:authzforce:xacml:request-filter:default-strict` changed to `urn:ow2:authzforce:feature:pdp:request-filter:default-strict`;
	- `urn:ow2:authzforce:xacml:request-filter:multiple:repeated-attribute-categories-strict` changed to `urn:ow2:authzforce:feature:pdp:request-filter:multiple:repeated-attribute-categories-strict`;
	- `urn:ow2:authzforce:xacml:request-filter:multiple:repeated-attribute-categories-lax` changed to `urn:ow2:authzforce:feature:pdp:request-filter:multiple:repeated-attribute-categories-lax`.

### Fixed
- Maven dependency: authzforce-ce-core-pdp-api upgraded to v4.0.0 fixing license headers 
- Fixed license headers (current year)
- Fixed out-of-date documentation in pdp.xsd on PDP extensions


## 3.9.0 
### Added
- New PdpExtensionLoader method providing the list of available extensions of a given type: datatype, function, combining algorithm, etc.

### Removed
- dnsName-equal and ipAddress-equal functions, which are not to be used because they are not in XACML spec (regexp-match equivalent must be used instead)

### Fixed
- NullPointerException when defining unknown combining algorithm ID in PDP configuration
- PdpExtensionLoader throwing IllegalArgumentException if no extension found of this type, instead of returning an empty list when the extension type is actually valid but no extension found

### Tests
- New tests for custom extensions: result filter (implements CombinedDecision from XACML Multiple Decision Profile), simple datatype (dnsname-value from XACML DLP/NAC Profile), complex datatype (XACML Policy), function (dnsname-value-equal from XACML DLP/NAC Profile), combining algorithm (on-permit-apply-second from XACML Additional Combining Algorithms Profile)


## 3.8.3
### Fixed 
- Removing Javadoc @author tag added automatically by maven Javadoc plugin without us knowing
- PDP schema: removed limits (100) for maxVarRefDepth and maxPolicyRefDepth attributes. Hard arbitrary limits should not be in the XML schema.


## 3.8.2
### Fixed
- Javadoc comments


## 3.8.1
### Fixed
- Removed use of SAXON StandardURIChecker for validating anyURI XACML AttributeValues causing "possible memory leak" errors in Tomcat, as confirmed by: https://sourceforge.net/p/saxon/mailman/message/27043134 and https://sourceforge.net/p/saxon/mailman/saxon-help/thread/4F9E683E.8060001@saxonica.com/. Although XACML 3.0 still refers to XSD 1.0 which has a stricter definition of anyURI than XSD 1.1, the fix consisted in using XSD 1.1 anyURI definition for XACML anyURI AttributeValues. In this definition, anyURI and string datatypes have same value space (refer to XSD 1.1 Datatypes document or SAXON note http://www.saxonica.com/html/documentation9.4/changes/intro93/xsd11-93.html or mailing list: https://sourceforge.net/p/saxon/mailman/saxon-help/thread/4F9E683E.8060001@saxonica.com/) , therefore anyURI-specific validation is removed and anyURI values are accepted like string values by the program. However, this does not affect XML schema validation of Policy/PolicySet/Request documents against OASIS XACML 3.0 schema, where the XSD 1.0 definition of anyURI still applies.


## 3.8.0
### Changed
- PDP XML schema: maxVariableRefDepth and maxPolicyRefDepth attributes made optional (instead of required)

### Added
- PDP XML schema: 'requestFilter' attribute (RequestFilter extension): 
	- Added documentation about natively supported values, with '-lax' suffix meaning that duplicate <Attribute> with same meta-data in the same <Attributes> element of a Request is allowed (in compliance with XACML 3.0 core spec, §7.3.3), and '-strict' suffix meaning that it is not allowed (not strictly compliant with XACML 3.0 Core, section 7.3.3):
		- 'urn:ow2:authzforce:xacml:request-filter:default-lax' and 'urn:ow2:authzforce:xacml:request-filter:default-strict': default requestFilter limited to what is specified in XACML 3.0 Core specification
		- 'urn:ow2:authzforce:xacml:request-filter:multiple:repeated-attribute-categories-lax' and 'urn:ow2:authzforce:xacml:request-filter:multiple:repeated-attribute-categories-strict': implement Multiple Decision Profile, section 2.3 (repeated attribute categories)
	- Added XSD-defined default value for this 'requestFilter' attribute: 'urn:ow2:authzforce:xacml:request-filter:default-lax'
- Support for Extended Indeterminate values (XACML 3.0 Core specification, section 7.10-7.14, appendix C: combining algorithms)
- PdpImpl#getStaticApplicablePolicies() method that provides all the PDP's applicable policies (root and referenced - directly or indirectly - from the root policy) if all are statically resolved. This allows PDP clients to know all the policies (if statically resolved) possibly used by the PDP during the evaluation.


## 3.7.0
### Added
- Root policy provider module based on any policy-by-reference provider (parameter is the root policy reference to be resolved by the policy-by-reference provider)

### Changed
- PDP configuration XSD version -> 3.6.1 (supporting new configuration type for the new ref-based Root policy provider module mentioned in previous section)

### Removed
- Moved/Refactored API classes sufficient for implementing PDP extensions (Datatypes, Functions, Policy/Attribute providers, etc.) to a separate project: authzforce-ce-core-pdp-api

### Fixed
- Broken validation of max policy reference depth


## 3.6.0
### Added
- Support all [XACML 3.0 conformance tests](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/xacml-comment/201404/msg00001.html) published by AT&T on XACML mailing list in March 2014, except IIA010, IIA012, IIA024, IID029, IID030, III.C.2, III.C.3, IIIE301, IIIE303, II.G.2-6 (see also [README](pdp-testutils/src/test/resources/conformance/xacml-3.0-from-2.0-ct/README.md) ); with specific adaptations and enhancements:
  1. XACML 3.0 Schema validation in all conformance tests (original files are not all compliant with XACML 3.0). 
  1. The original conformance test folder contains hundreds of files; for better readability and management, the folder is split in *mandatory* folder for tests on supported mandatory features (XACMl 3.0 core), *optional* folder for supported optional features (XACML 3.0 core and profiles), and *unsupported* for unsupported features.
  1. For tests requiring a custom attribute finder, added a file with suffix `AttributeProvider.xml` that configures the `TestAttributeProviderModule`. This configuration file must contain a list of `Attributes` elements defining the attributes that this attribute provider is able to provide, with their constant values.
  1. For tests requiring policies to be referenced via Policy(Set)IdReferences, added a directory named `refPolicies` containing a XACML Policy(Set) file per referenced Policy(Set).
  1. For tests of Request syntax validation (syntax error expected to be detected by Authzforce PDP at initialization-time, i.e. before any Request evaluation), added suffix `.ignore` to the original test Policy(Set) and Response files.
  1. For tests of Policy(Set) syntax validation (syntax error expected to be detected by Authzforce PDP at initialization-time, i.e. before any Request evaluation), added suffix `.ignore` to the original test Request and Response files.
- [HTML description](pdp-testutils/src/test/resources/conformance/xacml-3.0-from-2.0-ct/ConformanceTests.html) of XACML 3.0 conformance tests
- Support of Policy(Set)Version in Policy(Set)IdReference handled by the native policy finder
- Support for Variable evaluation in Policy with scope management (variable is local to Policy where defined and inherited by Rules)
- Added support of xpathExpressions (optional XACML feature) in Request with support of namespace-prefix mappings extracted from XML document (XACML Request/Policy(Set)/Rule) (typically via `xmlns` declarations) where the xpathExpression is defined, e.g. XACML Request or Policy(Set).
- PDP configuration option to enable/disable XPath support (evaluation of xpathExpression datatype in Request/Policy(Set)/Rule, AttributeSelector and xpath functions)
- Added support of RequestDefaults/XPathVersion (optional XACML features) for evaluation of xpathExpressions in Request, and PolicyDefaults/XPathVersion (optional XACML feature) for evaluation of xpathExpressions and AttributeSelectors in Policy(Set) documents.
- Added support of ReturnPolicyIdList (optional XACML feature) to return identifiers of policies found applicable for the Request
- Added support of xpath-node-count function (optional XACML feature)
- New modes of request parsing/filtering and attribute matching to enforce best practices and optimize Request processing:
  1. *Strict Attribute Issuer match*: in this mode, an AttributeDesignator without Issuer only matches XACML Request Attributes without Issuer (faster if all Attributes have an Issuer which is recommended, but not fully XACML (§5.29) compliant)
  2. *Allow Attribute duplicates*: allows defining multivalued attributes by repeating the same XACML Attribute (same AttributeId) within a XACML Attributes element (same Category). Indeed, not allowing this enables the PDP to parse and evaluate Requests more efficiently, especially if you know the Requests to be well-formed, i.e. all AttributeValues of a given Attribute are grouped together in the same `<Attribute>` element. However, it may not be fully compliant with the XACML spec according to a [discussion](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/xacml-dev/201507/msg00001.html) on the xacml-dev mailing list, referring to the XACML 3.0 core spec, §7.3.3, that indicates that multiple occurrences of the same `<Attribute>` with same meta-data but different values should be considered equivalent to a single `<Attribute>` element with same meta-data and merged values (multivalued Attribute). Moreover, the XACML 3.0 conformance test 'IIIA024' expects this behavior: the multiple subject-id Attributes are expected to result in a multi-value bag during evaluation of the `<AttributeDesignator>`.
- Features to prevent circular references in Policy(Set)IdReferences or VariableReference
- Features to limit depth of PolicySetIdReference or VariableReference chain (otherwise no theoretical limit)

### Changed
- TestMatchAlg class replaced with official conformance test on Target matching: group II.B.
- Improved `TestUtils` class to allow configuring a directory of referenced policies for Policy(Set)IdReferences, to enable/disable XPath support, and to configure a specific RequestFilter ID, e.g. to use the MultipleDecisionProfile for conformance tests of 'optional' features.
- Renamed RELEASE-NOTES.md to CHANGELOG.md to adopt conventions from [keepachangelog.com](http://keepachangelog.com).
- Logback dependency scope (maven) from `compile` to `test` (not required for compiling, only for tests, any SLF4J-compatible library may be used at runtime).
- Moved old README.md content to the server project since it does not apply anymore to this project but to the AuthzForce server project.

### Fixed 
- Issues reported by PMD and findbugs
- Fixed issues in [XACML 3.0 conformance tests](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/xacml-comment/201404/msg00001.html) published by AT&T on XACML mailing list in March 2014, see [README](pdp-testutils/src/test/resources/conformance/xacml-3.0-from-2.0-ct/README.md).
- In logical `OR`, `AND` and `N-OF` functions, an Indeterminate argument results in Indeterminate result. 
  1. FIX for OR function: If at least one True argument, return True regardless of Indeterminate arguments; else (no True) if there is at least one Indeterminate, return Indeterminate, return Indeterminate; else (no True/Indeterminate -> all false) return false
  1. FIX for AND function: If at least one False argument, return False regardless of Indeterminate arguments; else (no False) if there is at least one Indeterminate, return Indeterminate, return Indeterminate; else (no False/Indeterminate -> all true) return true
  1. FIX for N-OF function: similar to `OR` but checking if there are at least `N` Trues instead of 1, in the remaining arguments; else there is/are n True(s) with `n < N`; if there are at least `(N-n)` Indeterminate, return Indeterminate; else return false.
- Misleading IllegalArgumentException error for XML-schema-valid anyURI but not valid for `java.net.URI` class. Fixed by using `java.lang.String` instead and validating strings according to anyURI definition with Saxon library
- RuntimeException when no subject and no resource and no action attributes in the XACML request


## 3.5.8 - 2015-04-01
### Added
- New XACML 3.0 versions of (ordered-)deny-overrides and (ordered-)permit-overrides combining algorithms (ALGORITHM IS NOT THE SAME as in XACML 2.0)

### Changed
- Renamed classes of XACML 1.0/2.0 combining algorithms (Ordered)DenyOverrides and (Ordered)PermitOverrides to Legacy*, and replaced with new XACML 3.0 versions

### Fixed
